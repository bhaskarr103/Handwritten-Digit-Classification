    "When performing multiclass classification using an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) with the MNIST dataset, the pixel values (which range from **0 to 255**) are typically **normalized** to the range **0 to 1**. This is done for several reasons:\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. **Improves Training Stability**\n",
    "   - Neural networks work best when inputs have similar ranges, as large input values can lead to unstable gradients during backpropagation.\n",
    "   - Normalization ensures that all pixel values lie in a **consistent range**, improving numerical stability and preventing vanishing or exploding gradients.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. **Faster Convergence**\n",
    "   - Training deep networks with large input values (like 255) can slow down convergence.\n",
    "   - Scaling down input values helps in **faster and more efficient optimization** using gradient descent.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. **Prevents Large Weight Updates**\n",
    "   - If pixel values range from 0 to 255, initial weight updates may become very large, causing drastic changes in activations.\n",
    "   - Normalized values (0 to 1) lead to more **controlled and stable weight updates**, making training more effective.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. **Activations Work Better**\n",
    "   - Common activation functions like **sigmoid, tanh, and ReLU** work optimally when input values are within a small range.\n",
    "   - For example, the sigmoid function saturates for large values (e.g., 255), leading to **vanishing gradients**.\n",
    "   - Normalization ensures that the input values remain within an effective range where these functions can operate efficiently.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5. **Better Generalization**\n",
    "   - Models trained with normalized inputs generalize better to new data.\n",
    "   - If raw pixel values (0-255) were used, small changes in pixel intensity could lead to large variations in predictions.\n",
    "   - Normalized inputs help in **reducing sensitivity** to such variations.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **How Normalization is Done?**\n",
    "For MNIST, each pixel value is divided by **255** to scale it between **0 and 1**:\n",
    "\\[\n",
    "X_{\\text{normalized}} = \\frac{X}{255}\n",
    "\\]\n",
    "where **X** is the original pixel value.\n",

    "### **Summary**\n",
    "Normalization of MNIST pixel values (0-255 → 0-1) helps in:\n",
    "✅ Stable gradients  \n",
    "✅ Faster convergence  \n",
    "✅ Preventing large weight updates  \n",

    "Yes! In an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) for MNIST classification, the **Flatten layer** is used to convert the **28 × 28** pixel image (a 2D array) into a **1D array (vector) of size 784**. This is necessary because fully connected (dense) layers in ANNs expect **a single vector input rather than a 2D array**.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Why Use a Flatten Layer?**\n",
    "✅ **Transforms 2D Input into 1D**: Neural networks work with 1D input vectors in fully connected layers. The **Flatten layer** reshapes the 28×28 image into a **single row of 784 values**.  \n",
    "✅ **Ensures Compatibility with Dense Layers**: Dense layers (fully connected layers) require a **flat input**, so Flatten bridges the gap between convolutional layers (if any) and dense layers.  \n",
    "✅ **Preserves Information**: Unlike pooling or convolution, flattening does not lose any pixel data; it just reshapes the input.  \n",
